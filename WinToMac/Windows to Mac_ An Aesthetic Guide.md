### How do you hide the dock and menu bar?  
    In Windows, the bar at the bottom that displays all open and pinned applications is called the taskbar.  
    In macOS, this is called the dock or dockbar. Users can also hide the menu bar at the top in macOS.  

    Hiding these UI elements can give applications more screen space.  
    As a result, more content is visible to the user.

#### Hiding the dock
1. Click the Apple icon at the top left of your screen.
2. Select “System Preferences” from the dropdown menu.
3. Select the “Dock & Menu Bar” option.
4. In the Dock settings, check the box next to the “Automatically hide and show the Dock” option.

#### Showing the dock
Move your mouse to the bottom center of your screen, and the dock will slide into view.

#### Hiding the menu bar
1. Follow steps 1-3 from the “Hiding the dock” section above.
2. In Menu Bar settings, check the box next to the “Automatically hide and show the menu bar on the desktop” option.

#### Showing the menu bar
Move your mouse to the top of your screen, and the menu bar will slide into view.

### How do you change the theme? 
    Most people have a preferred theme in which they use their devices.  
    Whether this is simply the question of dark vs light mode or accent colors, most people have a preference.

#### Changing the main color mode (dark vs light)
1. Click the Apple icon at the top left of your screen.
2. Select “System Preferences” from the dropdown menu.
3. Select “General”.
4. In the “Appearance” section you can choose “Dark”, “Light”, or “Auto”.

#### Changing the accent color
1. Follow steps 1-3 from the “Changing the main color mode (dark vs light)” section.
2. In the “Accent Color” section, you can choose between 9 predefined colors (including a multicolor option).

#### Changing the desktop background
1. Click the Apple icon at the top left of your screen.
2. Select “System Preferences” from the dropdown menu.
3. Select “Desktop and Screen Saver”.
4. In the “Desktop” tab: Select one of the Apple provided background, a solid color, or your own image for the background.

### How do you split the screen?
    Sometimes a task may require you to switch between two windows.  
    In these scenarios, sharing or splitting the screen between these windows is more efficient.   
    The action is essentially the same on both Windows and macOS, but there are some differences.

#### Screen splitting on macOS vs on Windows.
1. On macOS, the two windows are technically in full screen, so minimize is disabled. On Windows, each window is still fully functional.
2. On macOS, leaving full screen in one of the windows will make the other window enter full screen by itself. In Windows, closing or maximizing one window will cause the other window to take up the entire screen space.
3. On macOS, you can only split the screen with two windows. In Windows, you can split the screen with up to four windows.


#### Splitting the screen
1. Open two windows in windowed mode (not fullscreen).
2. Hover over / click and hold the expand button in one of the windows.
3. Click on “Tile Window to Left of Screen” or “Tile Window to Right of Screen,” depending on whether you want the first window to be on the left or right.

### How do you set scroll direction and speed?
    The scroll direction is the direction the page moves when you scroll in a program or web page.  
    In Windows, scrolling down  moves the page “up,” allowing us to see what is lower “down” on the page.  
    If you have only used Windows up to now, this is what feels “natural” to you.  

    In macOS, however, the scroll direction is set to “natural” by default.  
    In order to see lower “down” on the page, you have to scroll up to drag the page “up.”   
    Thankfully, Apple included a setting that allows you to change the direction and speed to your preference.

#### Changing the scroll direction and speed
1. Click the Apple icon at the top left of your screen.
2. Select “System Preferences” from the dropdown menu.
Select “Mouse”
3. Uncheck “Scroll direction: Natural” to use the Windows scroll method and check it to use the macOS scroll method
4. Tweak the Tracking speed, Scrolling speed, and Double-Click speed values to your preference.
